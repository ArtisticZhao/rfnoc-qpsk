# gr-qpsk
Integrating UHD and fpga files into one directory

Based on copy block - Bypassing input into output

## Intro

This repo genrate from UHD-RFNOC toolchains. This RFNOC block is create to demodulate QPSK signals to rawdata in FPGA in order to speed up QPSK bitrate. 

## Source tree

The most things is generated by toolchains automatically. The most important folders will list:
  - rfnoc/fpga-src 
  - sim

The tested bitrate is 1.6Mbps. But the block require a higher SNR and have a high error rate. Maybe this caused by `bit_sync`.

The src located at `rfnoc/fpga-src/`
